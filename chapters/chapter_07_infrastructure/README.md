# Chapter 7: Infrastructure

This chapter focuses on building robust and scalable infrastructure for AI applications on AWS, with emphasis on AWS Bedrock, AWS AgentCore Runtime, serverless agent deployment, and production-ready infrastructure patterns.

## Learning Objectives
- Master AWS Bedrock infrastructure setup and model management
- Deploy AI agents to AWS AgentCore Runtime (serverless platform)
- Understand containerized AI agent deployment
- Learn production infrastructure patterns
- Implement monitoring and observability for AI systems

## Code Examples

### Infrastructure Management
- `bedrock_manager.py` - Model status and management utilities
- `bedrock_inference_profiles.py` - Inference profiles demonstration and management

### üöÄ **AgentCore Runtime Example** ‚úÖ **Successfully Deployed**
- `agentcore_runtime_example/` - **Complete working example deployed to AWS**
  - `my_agent.py` - Simple AgentCore-compatible agent (‚úÖ deployed)
  - `agentcore_strands_agent.py` - Enhanced agent with Windows Unicode fixes
  - `requirements.txt` - Minimal production dependencies
  - `.bedrock_agentcore.yaml` - Auto-generated deployment configuration
  - `README.md` - Comprehensive tutorial with troubleshooting guide
  - **Status**: Agent deployed and accessible via AWS Bedrock Console

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapters 1-6
- AWS infrastructure knowledge
- Understanding of CI/CD concepts
- Basic DevOps experience

## Key Topics Covered

1. **AWS Bedrock Infrastructure**:
   - Model access and permissions management
   - Inference endpoint configuration
   - Cost optimization strategies
   - Monitoring and logging integration

2. **AWS AgentCore Runtime** ‚≠ê **Featured Implementation**:
   - **Serverless agent hosting platform**
   - **ARM64 container deployment**
   - **Auto-scaling and managed infrastructure**
   - **Production-ready agent deployment**
   - **Real-world working example included**

3. **Containerized AI Deployment**:
   - Docker containerization for AI agents
   - AWS CodeBuild integration for ARM64 builds
   - ECR (Elastic Container Registry) usage
   - Deployment automation with agentcore CLI

4. **Production Infrastructure Patterns**:
   - Minimal dependency management
   - IAM role-based security
   - Environment configuration
   - Monitoring and observability setup

## üéØ **What You'll Build**

By completing this chapter, you will have:

‚úÖ **Deployed a real AI agent to AWS cloud infrastructure**
‚úÖ **Learned AWS AgentCore Runtime (serverless platform)**
‚úÖ **Mastered containerized AI deployment patterns**
‚úÖ **Implemented production-ready infrastructure**
‚úÖ **Gained hands-on AWS Bedrock experience**

## üìö **Student Learning Path**

1. **Start with AgentCore Example**: Explore the `agentcore_runtime_example/` directory
2. **Follow the Tutorial**: Complete README.md guide with step-by-step instructions
3. **Deploy Your Agent**: Use `agentcore deploy` to deploy to AWS
4. **Understand Architecture**: Learn serverless AI agent patterns
5. **Troubleshoot & Optimize**: Practice real-world deployment scenarios

## Production Considerations
- **Security**: IAM roles, least privilege access, secure environment variables
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs, metrics, and alerting integration
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling serverless architecture with AgentCore
- **Cost Optimization**: ARM64 containers, efficient resource usage
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region considerations and backup strategies

## Tools and Services
- **AWS Bedrock** - Foundation model access and management
- **AWS AgentCore Runtime** - Serverless AI agent hosting platform ‚≠ê
- **AWS CodeBuild** - ARM64 container builds
- **AWS ECR** - Container registry for agent images
- **AWS CloudWatch** - Logging and monitoring
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **agentcore CLI** - Official deployment toolkit

## Next Steps
After mastering infrastructure deployment with AgentCore Runtime, proceed to Chapter 8 to learn about **Observability & Evaluation** for production AI systems.
