# Chapter 4: Storage for Retrieval

This chapter covers storage solutions for retrieval-based AI systems, including vector databases, graph databases, hybrid retrieval methods, and AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand vector databases for semantic search
- Learn graph databases for relationship-based retrieval
- Implement hybrid retrieval strategies
- Master AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases

## Code Examples
*Code examples for this chapter will be added as the course progresses.*

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapters 1-3
- Understanding of embeddings and vector similarity
- Basic knowledge of database concepts

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Vector Databases**:
   - Embedding generation and storage
   - Similarity search algorithms
   - Vector indexing strategies
   - Popular vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)

2. **Graph Databases for Retrieval**:
   - Knowledge graph construction
   - Graph traversal for context
   - Neo4j and Amazon Neptune
   - Relationship-based queries

3. **Hybrid Retrieval**:
   - Combining semantic and keyword search
   - Reranking strategies
   - Multi-modal retrieval
   - Fusion techniques

4. **AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases**:
   - Setting up knowledge bases
   - Document ingestion and chunking
   - Retrieval configuration
   - Integration with LLMs

## Coming Soon
- Vector database implementation examples
- Graph database integration code
- Hybrid retrieval system demos
- AWS Knowledge Bases tutorials

## Next Steps
Proceed to Chapter 5 to learn about RAG & Agentic RAG systems.
