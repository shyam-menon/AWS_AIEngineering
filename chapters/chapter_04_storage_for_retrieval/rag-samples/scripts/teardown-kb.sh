AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base Teardown Script

This script safely removes all AWS resources created by setup-kb.sh:
1. Delete ingestion jobs and data sources
2. Delete Knowledge Base
3. Delete OpenSearch Serverless collection and policies
4. Delete IAM role and policies
5. Empty and delete S3 bucket
6. Clean up local configuration files

This script is designed to completely clean up the demo environment
and stop all charges from AWS resources.
