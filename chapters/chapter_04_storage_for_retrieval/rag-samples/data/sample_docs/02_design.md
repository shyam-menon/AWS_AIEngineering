# System Design Patterns for AI Applications

## Architecture Considerations

Designing robust AI systems requires careful consideration of several architectural patterns that address the unique challenges of machine learning applications. Unlike traditional software systems, AI applications must handle uncertainty, model drift, and the need for continuous learning.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

RAG represents one of the most important patterns in modern AI architecture. This approach combines the parametric knowledge stored in language models with external knowledge retrieved from databases or document stores.

**Vector Search Integration**: The core of RAG systems is efficient similarity search over high-dimensional embeddings. This requires choosing appropriate vector databases, embedding models, and indexing strategies. Consider factors like search latency, accuracy, and cost when designing your vector search infrastructure.

**Hybrid Retrieval Strategies**: Modern RAG systems often combine multiple retrieval approaches - semantic search through embeddings, keyword search, and structured queries. This hybrid approach provides better coverage and accuracy across diverse query types.

**Context Management**: Effective RAG systems must manage context length limits while providing relevant information. This involves strategies for chunk sizing, context compression, and intelligent selection of retrieved content.

## Multi-Agent Systems

As AI applications become more complex, multi-agent architectures provide a powerful pattern for decomposing problems into specialized components:

**Agent Specialization**: Different agents can be optimized for specific tasks - one for data retrieval, another for analysis, and a third for response generation. This specialization allows for better performance and easier maintenance.

**Communication Protocols**: Agents need structured ways to communicate and coordinate. This includes defining message formats, routing strategies, and error handling between agents.

**Orchestration Patterns**: Central orchestrators can manage complex workflows involving multiple agents, handling task distribution, result aggregation, and failure recovery.

## Caching and Performance Optimization

AI applications often involve expensive operations that benefit from intelligent caching:

**Prompt Caching**: Large language model calls can be expensive and slow. Caching responses for similar prompts can significantly improve performance and reduce costs.

**Embedding Caching**: Computing embeddings is computationally expensive. Caching embeddings for frequently accessed content improves response times.

**Model Caching**: Loading models into memory is often a bottleneck. Smart model caching strategies can improve cold start times and resource utilization.

## Monitoring and Observability

AI systems require specialized monitoring approaches that go beyond traditional application metrics:

**Model Performance Tracking**: Monitor accuracy, latency, and resource usage across different model versions and deployment environments.

**Data Drift Detection**: Implement systems to detect when incoming data differs significantly from training data, indicating potential model degradation.

**Cost Monitoring**: AI operations can be expensive. Track token usage, compute costs, and optimize resource allocation based on usage patterns.
