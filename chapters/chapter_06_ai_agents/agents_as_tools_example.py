Agents as Tools Example - Multi-Agent System

This example demonstrates the "Agents as Tools" pattern where specialized agents
are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by an orchestrator agent.

The system includes:
- Research Assistant Agent (for factual information)
- Product Recommendation Agent (for shopping advice)
- Travel Planning Agent (for trip recommendations)
- Code Helper Agent (for programming assistance)
- Main Orchestrator Agent (routes queries to specialists)

This creates a hierarchical multi-agent system where each agent has specialized
expertise and the orchestrator intelligently delegates tasks.
