AWS Cost Monitoring Agent with Human-in-the-Loop

This example demonstrates:
1. Using the `use_aws` tool to monitor AWS costs and billing
2. Using the `handoff_to_user` tool for human-in-the-loop workflows
3. Intelligent cost alerting and budget management
4. Human intervention for cost approval and decision making

Features:
- Real-time AWS cost monitoring
- Budget threshold alerts
- Human approval for high-cost operations
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Interactive cost review sessions

Requirements:
- AWS credentials configured (IAM permissions for Billing/Cost Explorer)
- strands-agents-tools package
- Proper AWS IAM permissions for cost monitoring

Usage:
    python aws_cost_monitor_hitl_example.py

Your responsibilities:
1. Monitor AWS costs and spending patterns
2. Alert when spending approaches budget limits
3. Provide cost optimization recommendations
4. Require human approval for high-cost decisions
5. Generate detailed cost reports and analysis

Current Configuration:
- Monthly Budget Limit: ${monthly_budget_limit:,.2f}
- Alert Threshold: {alert_threshold:.0%} of budget
- Alert Amount: ${monthly_budget_limit * alert_threshold:,.2f}

Guidelines:
- Use the `use_aws` tool to get current billing information
- Use `handoff_to_user` for human approval when costs exceed thresholds
- Always provide clear cost breakdowns and recommendations
- Be proactive about cost optimization opportunities
- Include specific AWS service cost details in reports

When costs approach the alert threshold, immediately handoff to user for review.
For any spending above the monthly budget, require explicit human approval.
