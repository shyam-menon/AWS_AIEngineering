# Chapter 5 Addition: Intelligent Query Routing Agent

## Summary

I have successfully built an **Intelligent Query Routing Agent** for Chapter 5: RAG & Agentic RAG. This addition demonstrates advanced agentic RAG patterns using the Strands Agent framework.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Implementation (`intelligent_query_router.py`)
- **IntelligentQueryRouter Class**: Main agent that analyzes queries and routes them intelligently
- **Query Analysis**: Classifies queries by type (technical, code, general, troubleshooting, comparison)
- **Multi-Source Routing**: Routes to optimal data sources based on query characteristics
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when primary sources fail
- **Performance Tracking**: Metrics collection for routing optimization

### 2. Strands Agent Tools
- `analyze_query_intent()` - Query classification and intent analysis
- `route_to_technical_docs()` - Technical documentation routing
- `route_to_code_search()` - Code repository and programming queries
- `route_to_general_knowledge()` - General knowledge base routing
- `route_to_troubleshooting()` - Problem-solving and support routing
- `execute_fallback_strategy()` - Intelligent fallback mechanisms
- `get_routing_metrics()` - Performance tracking and optimization

### 3. Supporting Files
- `test_intelligent_router.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `production_rag_integration.py` - Production integration example
- `INTELLIGENT_QUERY_ROUTING_README.md` - Detailed documentation

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Agentic RAG Patterns
1. **Intent-Driven Routing**: Agents analyze query intent to determine optimal routing
2. **Multi-Source Orchestration**: Intelligent orchestration of multiple data sources
3. **Self-Improving Systems**: Performance tracking for continuous improvement
4. **Robust Fallback**: Graceful handling of failures and edge cases

### Query Classification
- Technical Documentation (setup, configuration, API reference)
- Code-Related (implementation, examples, debugging)
- General Knowledge (concepts, explanations, overviews)
- Troubleshooting (errors, problems, solutions)
- Comparison (product comparisons, feature analysis)

### Routing Strategies
- **Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering** (for technical docs)
- **Code Semantic Search with Syntax Analysis** (for code queries)
- **Broad Semantic Search** (for general knowledge)
- **Problem-Solution Matching** (for troubleshooting)
- **Multi-Faceted Comparison Analysis** (for comparisons)

## Educational Value

This example teaches:
- How to build intelligent query routing systems
- Agentic patterns in RAG architectures
- Multi-source data orchestration
- Performance optimization and metrics tracking
- Production-ready RAG system design
- Strands Agent framework advanced usage

## Integration with Course

The example integrates seamlessly with:
- **Chapter 3**: Tool use patterns and agent architecture
- **Chapter 4**: RAG foundations and vector databases
- **Chapter 6**: Multi-agent systems (upcoming)
- **Chapter 7**: Infrastructure and scaling patterns

## Testing and Validation

- ✅ All tests pass (`test_intelligent_router.py`)
- ✅ Demonstration runs successfully
- ✅ Production integration example works
- ✅ Handles both Strands-available and demo modes
- ✅ AWS integration functional
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Usage Instructions

```bash
# Run the main demonstration
python intelligent_query_router.py

# Run the test suite  
python test_intelligent_router.py

# Run the production integration example
python production_rag_integration.py
```

This addition significantly enhances Chapter 5 by providing a practical, working example of sophisticated agentic RAG patterns that students can learn from and extend for their own use cases.
