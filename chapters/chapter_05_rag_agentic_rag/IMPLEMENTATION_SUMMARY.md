# RAG Evaluation Framework - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core Evaluation Framework
- **File**: `rag_evaluation_framework.py`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Multi-metric evaluation (Faithfulness, Context Relevance, Answer Relevance)
  - Configurable evaluation parameters
  - Detailed per-query analysis
  - Statistical analysis and reporting

### 2. CloudWatch Integration
- **File**: `cloudwatch_integration.py`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Automated metrics publishing to AWS CloudWatch
  - Dashboard creation for visualization
  - Alarm configuration for automated monitoring
  - 25+ metrics tracked including performance trends

### 3. Advanced RAG Evaluation System
- **File**: `advanced_rag_evaluation.py`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Continuous monitoring with scheduled evaluations
  - A/B testing framework with statistical significance
  - Performance trend analysis
  - Automated alerting for performance degradation

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### CloudWatch Timezone Issue
- **Problem**: `datetime.now()` not timezone-aware causing CloudWatch timestamp validation errors
- **Solution**: Replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for UTC timezone-aware timestamps
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `cloudwatch_integration.py` (line 70)
  - `advanced_rag_evaluation.py` (line 140)

## 📊 Demonstration Results

### CloudWatch Integration Test
```
📈 Published 25 metrics to CloudWatch namespace: Demo/RAG/Evaluation
📊 Created CloudWatch dashboard: Demo-RAG-Dashboard
🚨 Created 5 CloudWatch alarms for RAG monitoring
```

### Advanced RAG Evaluation Test
- **Continuous Monitoring**: ✅ Working
- **A/B Testing**: ✅ Working with 200 simulated interactions
- **Performance Alerts**: ✅ Triggered properly
- **CloudWatch Publishing**: ✅ All 12 metrics published successfully
