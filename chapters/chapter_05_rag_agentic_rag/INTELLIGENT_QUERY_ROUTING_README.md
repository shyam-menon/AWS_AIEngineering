### Agent Decision-Making

The Strands agent uses these tools to:

1. **Analyze Intent**: Understand what the user is really asking for
2. **Select Strategy**: Choose the optimal routing approach
3. **Execute Retrieval**: Perform targeted information retrieval
4. **Handle Failures**: Implement fallback mechanisms gracefully
5. **Learn and Adapt**: Improve routing decisions over time

## üéØ Demonstration Scenarios

### 1. Multi-Type Query Analysis

**Scenario**: Agent analyzes different query types and routes appropriately

**Test Queries**:
- Technical: "How to setup AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base?"
- Code: "Python RAG implementation example"
- General: "What is retrieval-augmented generation?"
- Troubleshooting: "Bedrock API timeout errors"
- Comparison: "FAISS vs Pinecone for vector storage"

### 2. Intelligent Fallback Handling

**Scenario**: Primary routing fails, agent uses fallback strategies

**Flow**:
1. Primary source (Bedrock KB) fails
2. Agent tries secondary source (Local Vector DB)
3. If all sources fail, uses direct LLM query
4. Tracks failure reasons for future optimization

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Scenario**: Agent learns from routing decisions to improve performance

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Success rates by source type
- Average confidence scores
- Query complexity correlation
- Response time optimization

## üîç Query Analysis Deep Dive

### Intent Classification

The router uses sophisticated pattern matching to classify queries:

```python
query_patterns = {
    QueryType.TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION: [
        "how to", "documentation", "api", "configuration", 
        "setup", "install", "deploy", "architecture"
    ],
    QueryType.CODE_RELATED: [
        "code", "function", "method", "class", "bug", 
        "error", "implementation", "algorithm"
    ],
    # ... additional patterns
}
```

### Complexity Scoring

Queries are scored 1-10 based on:
- Number of keywords
- Pattern matches
- Technical depth indicators
- Multi-part question detection

### Confidence Calculation

Routing confidence is calculated using:
- Pattern match strength
- Historical success rates
- Source availability
- Query clarity metrics
