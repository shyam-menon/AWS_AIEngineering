# Chapter 9: Security

This chapter ensures the safety and reliability of AI applications by implementing guardrails, testing LLM-based systems, and considering ethical implications.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement AI guardrails and safety measures
- Test LLM-based applications thoroughly
- Address ethical considerations in AI systems
- Understand AWS AgentCore security architecture

## Code Examples
*Code examples for this chapter will be added as the course progresses.*

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapters 1-8
- Understanding of security principles
- Knowledge of AI risks and limitations
- Basic ethics in AI concepts

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Guardrails**:
   - Content filtering and moderation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Output safety checks
   - Harmful content detection
   - Rate limiting and usage controls

2. **Testing LLM-based Applications**:
   - Adversarial testing methods
   - Red team exercises
   - Bias testing and detection
   - Performance under edge cases
   - Security vulnerability assessment

3. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Fairness and bias mitigation
   - Privacy protection
   - Transparency and explainability
   - Responsible AI principles
   - Stakeholder impact assessment

4. **AWS AgentCore Security Architecture**:
   - Identity and access management
   - Data encryption and protection
   - Network security measures
   - Audit logging and compliance
   - Threat detection and response

## Security Frameworks
- AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar
