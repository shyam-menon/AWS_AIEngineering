Python Fundamentals: Strands Agents Framework

This module demonstrates the Strands Agents framework - an open-source framework
for building AI agents that can interact with users, tools, and other agents.

Strands Agents provides a simple and powerful way to create, manage, and deploy
agents for AI engineering applications.
