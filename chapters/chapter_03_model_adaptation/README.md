# Chapter 3: Model Adaptation

This chapter focuses on adapting and customizing LLMs for specific needs through prompt engineering, tool use, fine-tuning techniques, and leveraging graph databases.

## Learning Objectives
- Master prompt engineering techniques
- Implement tool use patterns with LLMs
- Understand fine-tuning approaches
- Learn graph database integration for enhanced context

## Code Examples

### Prompt Engineering
- `prompt_engineering_example.py` - **Comprehensive demonstration of key prompt engineering principles**
- `PROMPT_ENGINEERING_README.md` - Detailed guide and documentation

### Advanced Conversation Patterns
- `bedrock_conversation.py` - Advanced conversation patterns and context management
- `nova_lite_chat.py` - Interactive chat with Amazon Nova Lite
- `nova_lite_cli.py` - Command-line interface with conversation presets

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapters 1-2
- Understanding of LLM basics
- AWS Bedrock access

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Prompt Engineering**: 
   - **Clarity and Specificity**: Clear, specific prompts for better results
   - **Persona Assignment**: Role-based responses with appropriate tone
   - **Few-shot Learning**: Using examples to improve task performance
   - **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Step-by-step thinking for complex tasks
   - **Combined Techniques**: Integrating multiple principles for optimal results

2. **Tool Use**:
   - Function calling patterns
   - Tool integration strategies
   - Error handling and validation

3. **Fine-tuning**:
   - When to fine-tune vs. prompt engineering
   - Data preparation for fine-tuning
   - Evaluation metrics

4. **Graph Databases**:
   - Knowledge graph integration
   - Contextual information retrieval
   - Relationship modeling

## Quick Start - Prompt Engineering

Run the comprehensive prompt engineering demonstration:

```bash
cd chapters/chapter_03_model_adaptation
python prompt_engineering_example.py
```

This will show you:
- âœ… Before/after comparisons for each principle
- ðŸŽ­ Different persona responses to the same task
- ðŸ“š Zero-shot vs. few-shot learning examples
- ðŸ”— Direct vs. chain-of-thought reasoning
- ðŸš€ All techniques combined for professional results

## Practical Exercises
- Build conversational agents with memory
- Implement tool-calling workflows
- Create custom prompt templates
- Design conversation flow patterns
- **Practice prompt engineering principles with your own use cases**

## Next Steps
Proceed to Chapter 4 to learn about Storage for Retrieval systems.
