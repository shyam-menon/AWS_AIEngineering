# Chapter 3: Model Adaptation

This chapter focuses on adapting and customizing LLMs for specific needs through prompt engineering, tool use, fine-tuning techniques, and leveraging graph databases.

## Learning Objectives
- Master prompt engineering techniques
- Implement tool use patterns with LLMs
- Understand fine-tuning approaches
- Learn graph database integration for enhanced context

## Code Examples

### Advanced Conversation Patterns
- `bedrock_conversation.py` - Advanced conversation patterns and context management
- `nova_lite_chat.py` - Interactive chat with Amazon Nova Lite
- `nova_lite_cli.py` - Command-line interface with conversation presets

## Prerequisites
- Completed Chapters 1-2
- Understanding of LLM basics
- AWS Bedrock access

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Prompt Engineering**: 
   - System prompts and user prompts
   - Few-shot learning examples
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning
   - Prompt templates and variables

2. **Tool Use**:
   - Function calling patterns
   - Tool integration strategies
   - Error handling and validation

3. **Fine-tuning**:
   - When to fine-tune vs. prompt engineering
   - Data preparation for fine-tuning
   - Evaluation metrics

4. **Graph Databases**:
   - Knowledge graph integration
   - Contextual information retrieval
   - Relationship modeling

## Practical Exercises
- Build conversational agents with memory
- Implement tool-calling workflows
- Create custom prompt templates
- Design conversation flow patterns

## Next Steps
Proceed to Chapter 4 to learn about Storage for Retrieval systems.
