# Strands Import Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The Strands framework was installed in the virtual environment but the examples were showing "Strands framework not available. Running in demonstration mode." This was due to incorrect import statements.

## Root Cause
The import statement was using:
```python
from strands import Agent, tool
```

But the correct import should be:
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools import tool
```

## Files Fixed

### Chapter 5: RAG & Agentic RAG
- ✅ `chapters/chapter_05_rag_agentic_rag/intelligent_query_router.py`

### Chapter 4: Storage for Retrieval  
- ✅ `chapters/chapter_04_storage_for_retrieval/rag-samples/strands_agent.py`

### Chapter 1: Coding & ML Fundamentals
- ✅ `chapters/chapter_01_coding_ml_fundamentals/python_strands_agents.py`
- ✅ `chapters/chapter_01_coding_ml_fundamentals/simple_strands_example.py`

### Chapter 3: Model Adaptation
- ✅ Already had correct imports in `strands_tool_use_example.py`

## Verification
All examples now work correctly with the Strands framework:

1. **Chapter 5 Tests**: All 5/5 tests pass ✅
2. **Chapter 5 Demo**: Intelligent query routing with full Strands functionality ✅  
3. **Chapter 5 Production**: Production RAG integration working ✅
4. **Chapter 1 Simple Example**: Agent with tools working ✅
5. **Chapter 4 RAG Agent**: Multi-tool RAG wrapper working ✅

## Key Improvements
- ✅ Strands agents are now properly created
- ✅ Tools are correctly registered and functional
- ✅ Agent thinking processes are visible
- ✅ Multi-tool workflows work as expected
- ✅ All fallback mechanisms still function when Strands is unavailable

The Strands framework is now fully functional across all course examples!
